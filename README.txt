*****LIAR'S DICE*****
*******TEAM 4********

RULES:
The game Liar's Dice is based on the Sorcery 2 mobile game, 
specifically the minigame within the main game. Our game starts 
with two players, one human user and the other AI. Each player 
is dealt a start of 5 dice, and all dice are rolled at once. 
Each player, starting with the human player, must bid the total 
number of dice that equal a specific face-value rolled by the 
player and AI opponent. The catch is that neither player can 
see the others dice. Once a bid is made the Player/AI will have 
the option to "call the bluff" of their opponent, in which case 
the round ends, and if the player's bluff was true, then the 
opponent loses one of their die, and if the bluff was false, the 
player loses one of his own die. The game is over once one player 
loses all their dice.

*Example of a bid could be: 5 fours, 3 ones, 6 twos, etc

**Example: if you have 3 fours and your opponent has 2 fours, and 
your opponent bids that there’s a total of 7 fours and you call it, 
you win that round and your opponent loses a die.
